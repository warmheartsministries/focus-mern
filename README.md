# FOCUS
*Conceptualized and developed by: Cynthia Altura Escano*

***

**FOCUS** is a layout and design agnostic content management system that provides organizations a directed and efficient way of setting up and managing their public information that's intended to be showcased in websites or public apps. It captures and stores the following information:

- Branding and Marketing Taglines
- Hours, events, and areas of operations
- Contact information and links to social media accounts
- Team and organization's makeup and culture as portrayed in its history, vision, mission, and belief statements
- Featured video and list of videos
- Featured products, programs, or events, each mapped to a document or blog.
- Customized forms and form submission reports that can also be downloaded in CSV.
- Announcements or alerts

Secure access to the system is ensured with integrations to a 3rd party authentication service. Easy integration to a 3rd party data storage solution ensures permanent storage of data, so information is kept intact even when website user interface frameworks or design change.

## MERN Technical Stack

**FOCUS** is basically a MERN app that was built and deployed using the following core technologies:

**MONGOOSE** is a MongoDB object modeling for NodeJS. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution for modeling the application data.

**EXPRESS** is a NodeJS web application framework. It is a middleware that is lightweight and provides flexible routing. It easily integrates with data storage solutions like MongoDB or PostgreSQL and with 3rd party authentication service like Auth0.

**REACT** is a JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. It allows modular development of user interfaces using components. This provides ease of development, code maintenance and code reusability. It integrates easily with other full-stack frameworks like NodeJS, Next, or Python Flask. Client side routing was implemented using ReactRouter.

**TYPESCRIPT** was implemented both in server-side and client UI front-end codes. Typescript is helpful in catching coding mistakes that would have otherwise occurred at runtime.

**MATERIAL UI** is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.

**Auth0 by Okta** is used for authentication.
